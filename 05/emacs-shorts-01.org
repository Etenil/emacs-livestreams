#+TITLE: Emacs shorts 01: Tramp, Dired and Undo

* Undo

  Emacs is very old as software goes. When it was created many
  features we take for granted didn't exist yet, like C-x/C-c/C-v and
  of course the undo/redo feature. Therefore Emacs'undo is quite
  unusual, but very powerful.

  and convenient.
