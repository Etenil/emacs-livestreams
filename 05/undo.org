#+TITLE: Undo

The ergonomy of Emacs pre-dates what is now accepted as convention for
the usual copy/paste/undo systems, and so some things are very
different. Undo is one of them.

* Undoing

  When starting to undo using a keybind like C-/, Emacs will
  implicitly initiate an /undo sequence/. You can carry on hitting C-/
  to go back in time until you've found what you wanted; any other
  keybind will break the /undo sequence/.

  The =undo= action itself is registered in Emacs'undo
  system. Therefore, after breaking from an /undo sequence/, it's
  possible to undo the undo action, which equates to re-doing.

  This is a bit odd, but works quite well.
